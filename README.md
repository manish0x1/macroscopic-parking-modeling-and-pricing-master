# Macroscopic Parking Modeling and Pricing

This project provides a **macroscopic simulation model** for analyzing urban parking systems and evaluating pricing strategies using Python. It helps in understanding the effects of pricing on parking demand and utilization at a large (city-wide) scale.

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Model parking dynamics at a macroscopic (aggregate) level
- Analyze the impact of pricing policies on parking occupancy and revenue
- Provide a simulation tool for urban planners and researchers

---

## 🧠 Key Features
- Flexible macroscopic model for supply-demand interaction
- Dynamic pricing simulation
- Sensitivity analysis for various parameters (e.g., price elasticity, supply changes)
- Visual output of simulation results

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for plotting and data visualization)
